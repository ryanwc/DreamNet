# DreamNet

A social "dream journal" (blog) that enables analysis of individual and collective dream trends to help everyone be more aware of themselves and their surroundings, thus spurring growth of a healthier and more pleasant world.

# Description

It's our belief that they key to experiencing the most joyful moments and solving the most important problems at both the micro and macro scales is awareness.  However, few of us can claim much awareness of ourselves, let alone of others or of the world's problems, small and large.

By understanding our subconscious, we understand a large contributor to the reasons behind our actions, and can take conscious steps to mold our lives to agree with this powerful, unseen force.  In doing so, we come one step closer to a world where people don't starve while others throw away food, where people don't jump off buildings in metropolises because they feel lonely, and where people don't physically or mentally damage one another -- not because these things cannot be done, but because the situations in which it is adventageous to do so simply do not arise.
