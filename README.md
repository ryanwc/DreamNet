# DreamNet

A social "dream journal" (blog) that provides analysis of individual and collective dream trends to help everyone be more mindful, conscious, and aware, thus spurring a healthier existence for us and the world.

# Description

It's our belief that they key to experiencing the most joyful moments and solving the most important problems at both the micro and macro scales is awareness.  However, few of us can claim much awareness of ourselves, let alone of others or of the world's problems, small and large. [insert interesting facts about subconscious and dreams etc to illustrate ].

By understanding our subconscious, we understand why we really do the things we do, and can take conscious steps to mold our lives to agree with this powerful, unseen force.  In doing so, we come one step closer to a world where people don't starve while others throw away food, where people don't jump off buildings in metropolises because they feel lonely, and where people don't physically or mentally damage one another -- not because it cannot be done, but because the situations in which it is possible to do so simply do not arise.

By fostering a community of light in the darkness of the collective subconscious, this website increases users' awareness of themselves, and, through statistical analyis of users' dreams, brings us one step closer to the real dream: liberty and justice for all.
